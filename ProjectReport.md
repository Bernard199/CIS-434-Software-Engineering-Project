## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The primary goal of the software is to deliver a lightweight, easy-to-use task management tool that can be accessed through a web portal. The software aims to:
- Provide users with a web-based platform to create, update, delete, and manage tasks effectively.
- Ensure high responsiveness, with task views loading in under 2 seconds for up to 100 tasks.
- Design a scalable and modular architecture that can accommodate future enhancements such as task delegation.

### 1.2 Product Overview

The software will offer a web-based interface that allows users to manage their tasks, including creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Users can categorize tasks, set deadlines, assign priorities, and view upcoming tasks. Core features include:
- **Task Management**: Creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.
- **Task Filtering**: Organizing tasks by categories or priorities.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and user role management.

### 1.3 Structure of the Document

The document is organized into sections covering project management, requirement specifications, architecture, design, testing, and conclusions.

### 1.4 Terms, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **UI**: User Interface.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.

## 2. Project Management Plan

### 2.1 Project Organization

The team consists of two members, Chase Ivanicic and Bernard Schweter, responsible for design, development, testing, and documentation.

### 2.2 Lifecycle Model Used

The project technically used a Waterfall methodology, progressing through distinct phases including requirement gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Initially, an Agile methodology was considered, but the development followed a more sequential, phase-based approach typical of Waterfall.

### 2.3 Risk Analysis

Key risks include:
- **Budget Constraint Risk**: The project lacks funding, limiting tool choices. This was mitigated by using free or open-source tools only.
- **Hosting Issues**: Self-hosting the system required careful planning and adequate hardware allocation. Clear documentation was provided to address setup challenges.
- **Scope Creep**: The project might outgrow core functionality. To mitigate this, the team focused on core features with a simple timeline to prevent excessive feature addition.

Expand on the mitigation strategies for risks:
- **Scope Creep**: Enforce strict adherence to core features like task creation, filtering, and management. Use a backlog for non-critical features to prioritize effectively during development.
- **Budget Constraint Risk**: The entire development utilizes open-source tools like FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and self-hosting on a Dell server, minimizing costs.

### 2.4 Hardware and Software Resource Requirements

- **Hardware**: Standard development hardware with Linux/Windows OS and a Dell server for self-hosting.
- **Software**: PostgreSQL, FastAPI, GitHub, and self-hosted deployment.

### 2.5 Deliverables and Schedule

The project deliverables were developed over a one-month timeline, divided into the following tasks:
- **Week 1**: Software requirement specification.
- **Week 2**: Database development and API development.
- **Week 3**: Front-end development.
- **Week 4**: Testing and documentation.

Align this section with the detailed timeline from the project plan:
- **October 10th**: Requirement specification completed.
- **October 20th**: Database and API development finalized.
- **November 1st**: Front-end design completed.
- **November 15th**: Testing and documentation submitted for review.

- **Delete Task**: Enables users to remove an existing task. The system prompts for confirmation before deleting the task.
  - **Actors**: Regular User, Admin User
  - **Preconditions**: User must have an existing task to delete.
  - **Postconditions**: Task is permanently removed from the system.

- **View Tasks**: Allows users to view a list of tasks, with options to filter by category, priority, or deadline.
  - **Actors**: Regular User, Admin User
  - **Preconditions**: User must be logged in.
  - **Postconditions**: Task list is displayed.

## 6. Test Management

### 6.1 A Complete List of System Test Cases

The test plan focuses on core manual testing of the system's essential functionalities, including:
- **Functional Test Cases**: Tests for user authentication (valid and invalid credentials), access controls, form validation, CRUD operations for tasks, session timeout functionality, and error handling.
- **UI Test Cases**: Tests for responsiveness, accessibility, cross-browser compatibility, keyboard navigation, and form submission.
- **Security Test Cases**: Validation against XSS attacks and SQL injection.
- **Usability Test Cases**: Verifies usability of error messages, onboarding experience, and responsiveness on mobile devices.

Integrate the comprehensive test cases from the test plan. For example:
- Functional Test Cases (e.g., TC01 to TC08).
- UI Test Cases (e.g., responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility).
- Security Test Cases (e.g., handling SQL injection and XSS).

### 6.2 Traceability of Test Cases to Use Cases

Test cases are mapped to use cases such as Create Task, Edit Task, and Delete Task. For example, TC01 verifies user authentication, while TC04 ensures form validation for task creation.

### 6.3 Techniques Used for Test Case Generation

Boundary-value analysis, exploratory testing, and user acceptance testing were used to generate test cases.

### 6.4 Test Results and Assessments

Test results showed successful implementation of core functionalities, with defects identified and resolved in areas such as form validation and session management.

### 6.5 Defects Reports

Highlight:
- Session timeout inconsistencies were resolved by implementing stricter timeout policies.
- Form validation errors were fixed to ensure robust user input handling.

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1 Outcomes of the Project

The project successfully implemented core functionalities using FastAPI, ensuring high performance and a modular design. User authentication, task management, and audit logging were completed as planned.

### 7.2 Lessons Learned

Effective planning and regular testing are critical to project success. FastAPIâ€™s asynchronous nature enhanced performance but required additional learning for debugging. The Waterfall approach ensured a structured, phase-wise testing and development process.

### 7.3 Future Development
