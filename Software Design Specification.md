# SOFTWARE DESIGN SPECIFICATION 

## 1.0 Introduction 

This section provides an overview of the entire design document. This document describes all data, architectural, interface and component-level design for the software. 

### 1.1 Goals and objectives 

Overall goals and software objectives are described. 

### 1.2 Statement of scope 

A description of the software is presented. Major inputs, processing functionality, and outputs are described without regard to implementation detail. 

### 1.3 Software context 

The software is placed in a business or product line context. Strategic issues relevant to context are discussed. The intent is for the reader to understand the 'big picture'. 

### 1.4 Major constraints 

Any business or product line constraints that will impact the manner in which the software is to be specified, designed, implemented or tested are noted here. 

## 2.0 Data design 

A description of all data structures and databases. 

### 2.1 Data structures 

Data structures that are available to major portions of the architecture are described. 

### 2.2 Database description 

Database(s) created as part of the application is(are) described. 

## 3.0 Architectural and Component-Level Design

A description of the software architecture is presented.

### 3.1 Architecture Diagrams

Various views (logical, process, physical, development) of architecture are presented with descriptions.

### 3.2 Description for Components

A description of major software components contained within the architecture is presented. Section 3.2.1 is repeated for each of n components.

#### 3.2.1 Component n Description

##### 3.2.1.1 Interface Description

Input, output, exceptions, etc.

##### 3.2.1.2 Static Models

Class diagrams, composite structure diagram, etc.

##### 3.2.1.3 Dynamic Models

Activity diagrams, sequential diagrams, state diagrams, etc.

### 3.3 External Interface Description

The software's interface(s) to the outside world (other software or hardware systems) are described.

## 4.0 User Interface Design

A description of the user interface design of the software is presented.

### 4.1 Description of the User Interface

A description of user interface including screen images or prototype is presented.

### 4.2 Interface Design Rules

Conventions and standards used for designing/implementing the user interface are stated.

## 5.0 Restrictions, Limitations, and Constraints

Special design issues which impact the design or implementation of the software are noted here.

## 6.0 Appendices

Presents information that supplements the design specification.

### 6.1 Requirements Traceability Matrix

A matrix that traces stated components and data structures to software requirements is developed.

### 6.2 Implementation Issues
