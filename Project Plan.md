# Project Plan

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Project Scope
The project plans to create a task management software that allows users to create, organize, and manage tasks through a web portal. Users can assign priorities, set deadlines, and track progress. The software is targeted at individuals and small businesses.

### 1.2 Major Software Functions
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, edit, delete, and manage tasks.
- **Task History Tracking**: Tracks changes in task status.
- **Audit Log**: Monitors user actions.

### 1.3 Performance/Behavior Issues
No special performance or behavior requirements. The software will be lightweight as to support self-hosted and basic use cases.

### 1.4 Management and Technical Constraints
- The project has zero funding and must use only free or open-source tools.
- Self-hosting is currently the only viable option due to the lack of funding.
- Core functionality must be prioritized due to time and resource constraints.

## 2.0 Risk Management

### 2.1 Project Risks
- **Budget Constraint Risk**: The project lacks funding, limiting tool choices.
- **Scope Creep**: The project might outgrow core fuctionality.
- **Hosting Issues**: Variables in self hosting may pose a challenge.

### 2.2 Risk Table

| Risk Name                | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Budget Constraint Risk    | High        | Medium | Use free or open-source tools only |
| Scope Creep               | Medium      | High   | Stick to developing core functionality and follow a simple timeline|
| Hosting Issues            | Medium      | Medium | Provide clear documentation and use simple hardware and software |

### 2.3 Overview of Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, Management (RM3)
- Our risk mitigation entails using free tools, focusing on core functionality, and providing documentation for self-hosting. Risks will be reviewed against our timeline and budget constraints.
