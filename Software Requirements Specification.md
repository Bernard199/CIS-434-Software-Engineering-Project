### 1.0 Introduction

#### 1.1 Goals and Objectives
  - The goal of this software is to create an easy-to-use set of task management tools that can be accessed through a web portal. 
  - The objective is to provide users with a simple interface to create, organize, and manage tasks efficiently in an online environment.

#### 1.2 Statement of Scope
  - This software will allow users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks through a web-based interface. Users will be able to categorize tasks, set priorities, assign deadlines, and mark tasks as completed. 
    Additionally, users can view upcoming tasks and filter tasks based on category or priority, enabling them to efficiently track progress and manage their workload.

#### 1.3 Software Context
  - This software is intended for individuals and small business to keep track of personal tasks and larger projects.

#### 1.4 Major Constraints
  - The development of this software is constrained by limited resources, as it is a zero-profit, zero-funded project. The software must be developed using open-source or free tools, and it should be lightweight to     
    minimize hosting and infrastructure costs.
