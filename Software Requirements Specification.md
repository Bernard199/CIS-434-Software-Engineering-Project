    Additionally, users can view upcoming tasks and filter tasks based on category or priority, enabling them to efficiently track progress and manage their workload.

#### 1.3 Software Context
  - This software is intended for individuals and small business to keep track of personal tasks and larger projects.

#### 1.4 Major Constraints
  - The development of this software is constrained by limited resources, as it is a zero-profit, zero-funded project. The software must be developed using open-source or free tools, and it should be lightweight to     
    minimize hosting and infrastructure costs.
